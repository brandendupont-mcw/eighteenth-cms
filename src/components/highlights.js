              Graphic headings can be used a few different ways, depending on
              what your landing page is for. Highlight your values, specific
              program areas, or results.

              Keep body text to about 30 words. They can be shorter, but try to
              be somewhat balanced across all four. It creates a clean
              appearance with good spacing.

              to show those.
