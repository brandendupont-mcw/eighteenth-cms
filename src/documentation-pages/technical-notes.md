## Offense Levels 

**Felony**: Felonies are the most serious criminal violations of Colorado state laws (Colorado Revised Statutes), and include robbery, murder, rape, and possession of illegal drugs for sale. In Colorado, felonies are divided into six classes, with Class 6 being the lowest level of felony and Class 1 the most serious, with prison sentences ranging from 18 months to life in prison (or death penalty).  Fines may also be imposed.  There are also four classes of drug felonies, with Class 4 being the lowest, and Class 1 the highest, with prison sentences ranging from six months to 32 years in prison.

**Misdemeanor**: Misdemeanors are less serious criminal violations of Colorado state laws, punishable by a sentence of up to 18 months in county jail.  A person convicted of a misdemeanor cannot be sentenced to state prison, unless the misdemeanor sentence is served simultaneously (concurrently) with a felony sentence. In Colorado, misdemeanor offenses are divided into three classes, with Class 3 being the lowest level of misdemeanor and Class 1 the most serious. Misdemeanors cover a wide range of offenses, including serious traffic offenses, alcohol-related traffic offenses such as DUI and DWAI, careless driving resulting in injury or death, domestic violence, 3rd degree assault, 2nd degree forgery, indecent exposure, obstructing a police officer, theft less than $500, resisting arrest, criminal mischief with less than $500 damage, public fighting, prostitution and soliciting for prostitution, and underage drinking.

The definition will include attempted charges. Additionally, it includes Child Abuse resulting in Serious Bodily Injury (SBI) or Death.  For escape and extortion, given the wide range of potential charges, those charges are only included as a ‘Violent Crime’ when the District Attorney has charged the case with a crime of violence sentence enhancer.

## Dispositions

**Dismissed**:  Termination of a criminal charge by the court or by the prosecutor after the case is filed. This category includes cases where the case was dismissed for any reason. This can be a lack of evidence or unavailability of a witness, or a dismissal where we determine it is in the interests of justice, or as part of a plea agreement. This category also includes those cases that are referred to diversion, as those cases are dismissed as well.

**Plea Dismissal**: It is not uncommon for defendants to have multiple criminal cases going on at the same time. A defendant may be able to resolve such a situation by pleading guilty to some of the cases in exchange for others being dismissed. So, if a defendant pleads guilty to two cases in exchange for the dismissal of a third, those cases would each be counted separately, two as pleas and the third as a dismissal.

**Deferred Judgment**: A deferred judgment is a temporary guilty plea. The defendant accepts responsibility such as service hours, probation, payment of restitution, or counseling or treatment related to their case. If they comply with the terms, their guilty plea is withdrawn and the case is dismissed. If they do not comply with the terms, then the case is reopened and subsequently convicted.

**Acquitted**: Acquittals occur upon a judgment that a person is not guilty of the crime with which the person has been charged. A person may be acquitted by a judge or a jury.

**Found Guilty**: A defendant is found guilty when found guilty at trial of any charge.

**Plead Guilty**: A defendant pleads guilty when they admit guilt for a crime, sometimes in exchange for a more lenient sentence
