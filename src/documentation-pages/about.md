# **Why did we develop this dashboard?**

The dashboard seeks to support:

* **Transparency.** Ensuring that the DA’s office is communicating what it is doing and the outcomes of its work.
* **Efficiency**. Ensuring that the DA’s office is using resources wisely and being good stewards of public funding.
* **Community Safety and Well-Being**. Ensuring that the DA’s office is addressing serious crime and protecting and serving victims.
* **Justice and Fairness**. Ensuring that the DA’s office is identifying and prioritizing actions to reduce disparities at points of prosecutorial discretion and to ensure the fair treatment of victims and defendants.
* **Data-driven Decision-making.** Ensuring that the DA’s office is learning what is going well and where there is room for improvement, ensuring decisions are grounded in systematically collected data.

Colorado’s criminal justice system is a collaboration between lawmakers, law enforcement, DAs, judges, and the community. The DA’s office prosecutes cases, provides assistance to witnesses and victims of crime, and oversees alternative programming such as diversion and restorative justice.
