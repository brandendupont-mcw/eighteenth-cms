# Deferral and Diversion Outcomes

Deferred judgments and Diversion programming are alternatives to traditional prosecution. An individual granted a deferred judgment must complete a probationary period during which they must have no other criminal violation and meet certain conditions, such as paying restitution or completing drug education classes. An individual granted a diversion must fulfill a set of conditions that address, treat, or remedy issues related to or raised by the allegations against them. If programmatic requirements are met, both for deferrals and diversion, the case will be dismissed.

This dashboard presents data on the outcomes of deferred judgment and diversion cases to understand if the conditions were met.Â 

**Why is this important?** Understanding the success rate of deferrals provides information on whether the conditions imposed minimized unnecessary punitiveness while centering community safety.
