Welcome to the 18th Judicial District Public Data Dashboards.  Being open and transparent is one of District Attorney John Kellner’s CORE values, and this tool will make more information available to the public about what we do on an ongoing basis in an interactive manner. 

To the best of our ability, the information presented here is useful and reliable, but it is important to acknowledge some limitations: The data is only as good as the data that exists, and that always involves human input and automated calculations.  We expect and acknowledge that, on the individual case level, there will be inaccuracies.

Regarding race and ethnicity: Ideally, race and ethnicity data would be based on voluntary self-identification, but the source of this information is varied and may come from law enforcement, the courts, or self-identification.  Further complicating matters, the state court system doesn’t have a data field to track ethnicity.  We will continue to work with our partners to develop better ways to present this information accurately, but are providing the information we have understanding the limitations.

If you are seeking additional information about a specific case, you can request** [public records from the court](https://www.courts.state.co.us/Self_Help/Research/index.cfm),** or** [request additional record from our office here](https://www.da18.org/records-request/)**. Please remember that our ability to share information or comment on a pending case remains limited by the **[Colorado Rules of Professional Conduct](https://www.cobar.org/rulesofprofessionalconduct)**, and specifically by **[Rule 3.6](https://www.cobar.org/For-Members/Opinions-Rules-Statutes/Rules-of-Professional-Conduct/Rule-36-Trial-Publicity)** and **[Rule 3.8](https://www.cobar.org/For-Members/Opinions-Rules-Statutes/Rules-of-Professional-Conduct/Rule-38-Special-Responsibilities-of-a-Prosecutor)**.If you have questions or comments about this project, or have ideas about additional data points you would like to see included, please **[submit those comments here](https://www.da18.org/about/contact/)**.
